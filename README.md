Light and sound memory game that outputs a series, of frequencies and light up buttons, that gets incremented by one each round if the user correctly repeats the sequence. The game continues until either the user gets 3 strikes or they complete all 8 sequences ranging in ascending order from a 1 button sequence to an 8 button sequence.
